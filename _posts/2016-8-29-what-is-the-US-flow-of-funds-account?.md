title: What is the US flow of funds account (FoF Account)?
---

**_v1.0_**

The Federal Reserve describes it like this:

```
From the beginning, the emphasis has been on providing statements of of total sources of funds flowing to economic sectors and the sectors' uses of funds.
```

The report is published four times a year and can be found in a variety of formats [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/).

NOTE: The numbers or series in the FoF account don't have a one-to-one equivalent on [FRED](http://hackeconomics.com/what-is-FRED/).
