title: What is the M2 money supply and its components? 
---

**_v1.1_**

Prerequisites: [savings deposits](http://hackeconomics.com/what-are-the-total-amount-of-savings-deposits-in-the-US/), [small time deposits](http://hackeconomics.com/What-are-the-total-amount-of-small-time-deposits-in-the-US/), and [retail money funds](http://hackeconomics.com/What-are-the-total-amount-of-retail-money-funds-in-the-US/)

Over the last few posts Iâ€™ve looked at various forms of money beyond M1: [savings deposits](http://hackeconomics.com/what-are-the-total-amount-of-savings-deposits-in-the-US/), [small time deposits](http://hackeconomics.com/What-are-the-total-amount-of-small-time-deposits-in-the-US/), and [retail money funds](http://hackeconomics.com/What-are-the-total-amount-of-retail-money-funds-in-the-US/). If you add them all up plus the results of M1 they total another measure of the total supply of money known as M2.

The following chart shows M2 and its components for a particular point in time.
