title: What are open market operations? 
---

Open market operations are _are the Federal Reserve's most flexible and frequently used means of implementing U.S. monetary policy._[1](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html) Monetary policy is generally the goal of the Federal Reserve to achieve:

- “maximum” sustainable output and employment 
- “stable” prices. 

Open market operations are used by the federal reserve to purchase U.S. Treasury securities and/or mortgage backed securities or sell already purchased securities of the same type in order to affect the amount of bank reserves. I'll also look at how this buying/selling helps to achieve maximum sustainable output and employment as well as stable prices.
