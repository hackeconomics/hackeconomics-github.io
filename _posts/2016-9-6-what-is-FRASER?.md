[FRASER](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/) is defined by the fed reserve as: 

> The Federal Reserve Archival System for Economic Research (FRASER) began as a data preservation and accessibility project of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in 2004. FRASER’s mission is to safeguard and provide easy access to economic history—particularly the history of the Federal Reserve System. Providing economic information and data to the public is an important mission for the St. Louis Fed. We continue the proud tradition, started by former St. Louis Fed Research Director Homer Jones in 1958, by offering digital access to historical policy documents and data to scholars, economists, analysts, students, and interested observers of the U.S. economy. As part of this mission, FRASER staff occasionally add digital material to FRASER from other sources such as the Internet Archive and the American Memory program of the Library of Congress to provide further context for materials digitized for FRASER. FRASER can be used in conjunction with other Federal Reserve resources, including FRED, ALFRED, the Federal Reserve System History Web Gateway, and curriculum materials developed by the Fed’s economic education staff. Additionally, where appropriate, we add links to FRASER resources from relevant Wikipedia pages to connect the public to our free economic history materials.
