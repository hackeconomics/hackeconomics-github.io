Prerequisites: [currency](http://hackeconomics.com/How-much-U.S.-currency-is-currently-in-circulation/), [demand deposits](http://hackeconomics.com/What-is-a-demand-deposit/), [other checkable deposits](http://hackeconomics.com/What-are-other-checkable-deposits/)

Over the last few posts I've looked at various forms of money: [currency](http://hackeconomics.com/How-much-U.S.-currency-is-currently-in-circulation/), [demand deposits](http://hackeconomics.com/What-is-a-demand-deposit/), [other checkable deposits](http://hackeconomics.com/What-are-other-checkable-deposits/). If you add them all up they total one measure of the total supply of money known as M1.

The following chart shows M1 and its components for a particular point in time.
