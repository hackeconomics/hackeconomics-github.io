### Organization of the site
The site is organized into three sections: blog, questions, and about. The blog posts are always titled with a question similar to my first post: [How much U.S. currency is currently in circulation?](http://hackeconomics.com/How-much-U.S.-currency-is-currently-in-circulation/). Some of the questions will be a bit sexier than others but they will all share a similar format. At the top there's a version number. The answers to the questions evolve and therefore each "major" or "minor" iteration has a version number. Each question can also be found "in context" in the [questions](http://hackeconomics.com/questions/) page. 

### Why "hack" in hackeconomics?
So this post is entitled "hello world" for a reason. Despite this being a blog about economics it is rooted in a programming paridigm. I constantly see programming patterns in real life and therefore think they can be applied to everything. This may make me delussional but that could be interesting as well. Hacking to me is breaking down problems into workable chunks to better understand them. So much of economics today is mired in unneeded complexity or an assumption that we  understand countlesss definitions and dependencies of a given chart or article. I want to change that.
